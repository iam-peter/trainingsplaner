# QML imports for deployment

Not part of the program. The deployment tools (windeployqt, macdeployqt,
linuxdeploy-plugin-qt) copy only the QML modules they find imported in
QML files. The program's style is built into it and loaded by name at
start, so the tools never see what it imports; `Style.qml` imports that,
and Basic, which the style falls back to for the controls it leaves out.
